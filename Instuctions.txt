Open this project then, Go to the server directory of the project in your termial. Path (/schoolmanagement/server). This would install dependices needed
Then once on server directory type the command below

- npm install

Go to the dbconfig.js file (/server/controllers/dataModels.js).
On lines 6-9 put your mysql database creds. (Database used for step 3).

const connection = mysql.createConnection({
  host: "localhost on dbconfig.js line 6",
  user: "put username on dbconfig.js line 7",
  password: "put password on dbconfig.js line 8",
  database: "put database name on dbconfig.js line 9",
});

After the connection has been made. Make sure your termial is still in the /server directory and then start the server with the command below

- node index.js

You'll know everything works if you see the text below in the termial

- Server started on port 3001
- Connected to MySQL database
